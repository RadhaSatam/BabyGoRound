# BabyGoRound

BabyGoRound supports families living in poverty, single parents, refugees, and mothers living in homeless shelters by giving them access to essential supplies. Their volunteers have one-on-one appointments with families to select the items they need. They anticipate assisting close to 900 families per year. 

This is a part of the VanHacks 2018 Hackathon. We're a team of 5 - Alice, Eina, Harry, Radha and Sam and we're building a web app for this volunteer run organization's administrative tasks and inventory management.
